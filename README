Robotics Cape Library Installer 
For BeagleBone Black and BeagleBone Blue Running Debian Jessie.
See the wheezy_archive branch for old Wheezy-compatible code.


We recommend runnging this package with the latest lxqt 4gb image available here:
http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack_Debian#Flasher:_.28lxqt-4gb.29_.28BeagleBone_Black.2FGreen_4GB_eMMC.29
The Beaglebone community is very active and we try to keep up with the rapid development.


We also recommend using the most recent 4.4-series rt kernel. Right now that is 4.4.24-ti-rt-r55
The real-time (rt) kernels provide improved performance with fast IMU sensor sampling. 
However, the non-real-time kernels provided in system images are perfectly fine for most 
use cases.

	root@beaglebone:~/ cd /opt/scripts/tools/
	root@beaglebone:/opt/scripts/tools# git pull
	root@beaglebone:/opt/scripts/tools# ./update_kernel.sh --lts-4_4 --ti-rt-kernel
	root@beaglebone:/opt/scripts/tools# reboot



RoboticsCape Installtion Method #1: Package Manager

	If you are using a BeagleBone Black or Blue with a working internet connection then
	you may elect to pull the roboticscape package from our repository with apt.
	This will allow future updates to the package with apt-get upgrade.

	sudo echo "deb http://strawsondesign.com debian/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get install roboticscape

	BeagleBone Black users must take one additional step. After installing the
	package, run the configure_robotics_overlay.sh shell script from the command
	line to set up the RoboticsCape device tree overlay. This only needs to be done
	once after installation. After that all updates to the library binaries itself 
	may be pulled using apt-get.



RoboticsCape Installtion Method #2: Compile from Source
	
	1) Download the source files from github:
	https://github.com/StrawsonDesign/Robotics_Cape_Installer/archive/master.zip

	2) Unzip the source code package to the /root/ directory of your BeagleBone

	3) Log in as root and execute the install.sh script. You will be prompted with
   	further instructions during installation.

   	root@beaglebone:~# cd Robotics_Cape_Installer
   	root@beaglebone:~/Robotics_Cape_Installer# bash install.sh
	
	4) BeagleBone Black users must take one additional step. After installing the
	package, run the configure_robotics_overlay.sh shell script from the command
	line to set up the RoboticsCape device tree overlay. Reboot when complete.
	
	root@beaglebone:~# configure_robotics_overlay.sh
	root@beaglebone:~# reboot
	
	5) If all went well, restarting will result in the selected example
  	program loading on boot. If the blink example was selected, both red and 
	green LEDs should be responsive to button presses.
